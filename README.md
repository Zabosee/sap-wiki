Converting a GitHub Pages - UI5 Project to an App

## Information

The project was mainly created for the developer [wridgeu](https://github.com/wridgeu).

The goal of this App is to go live on the Google Play Store. The App is going to be free for everyone
but you have to sign up to use it. Through this i'm making sure no one is abusing the App.

## Launch

For the first launch the App will be as minimal as it could be. So no zooming in pictures or special
animation.
