## Introduction

Using the already existing controls in UI5 isn't always the best way to solve an issue or handle a specific scenario. Therefore UI5 offers great extensibility with extending already existing controls or creating new ones from scratch which we then can reuse as often as needed.

But it doesn't stop with only controls. You can even extend the UI5 tooling or the Fiori-Launchpad itself ... the list goes on.
